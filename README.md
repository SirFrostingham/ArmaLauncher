Arma Launcher is written in c#, xaml, wpf and is a work in progress for years.

History (Years of side-work development):

	- The original intent was to create an Arma 2 launcher
	- Then Arma 3 released and switched the program to target that
	- Then Gamespy server lister server ended
	- Then re-targeted the application to use a Steam Query library (see: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/8834/A-gameserver-query-library)
	- Then decided to clean up the code and start using MVVM pattern
	- Then decided to use a different QueryMaster (see: https://querymaster.codeplex.com/)
	- Then decided to introduce a provider pattern, for fast switching between Steam query libraries
	- Then recently decided to expand the games to other Steam appids (such as DayZ SA, Ark, and Emperyion survival games)

	
What this app can do:

	- Server lister for any Steam game (Arma 3, DayZ, Arma 2, ARK, Emperyion currently included)
		- The new target appids just need to be threaded through.
	- Launch game and connect to target server with customized parameters
	- Add favorite servers
	- Write notes about servers
	- Add friends and enemies
	- Track friends and enemies
	- Recent servers
	- Settings: Configure your game launch directories and launch parameters


Where are we at with this application?

	- It's a work in progres...
	- I have been working on this for YEARS and well I am out of gas.
	- I want to share it and see where that goes...
	- It would be great to get other contributors!
